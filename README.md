# Perkinson-s-Disease-Detection
Perkinson's disease Detection using machine learning.
The project involved analysis of the perkinson's disease patient dataset with proper data processing. Then, different models were trained and and predictions are made with different algorithms KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest,SVM,Logistic Regression etc.
Machine Learning algorithms used:

        1.Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
        
        2.Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
        
        3.Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
        
        4.K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
        
        5.Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
        
Accuracy achieved: 92.5% (using Random Forest model)
